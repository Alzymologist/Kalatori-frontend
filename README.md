# Kalatori-frontend
Collection of frontends for Kalatori Substrate-based web shop. Example demo deployments should be running (normally, this is low-budget demo, not some high availability setup) for all models, see links below. The demo deployments use the newer backend version and thus have more features but are also not stable. To place an "order", use Alice's account in any Substrate-compatible wallet:

`bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice`
